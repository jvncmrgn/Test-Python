### Purpose

This repository was created as a container for all the assignments and learnings I've encountered during my college years and also my leisure time. I believe that learning is a continuous process, and by storing all my learning materials here, I can:

- **Track Progress**: I can see how my skills and understanding have evolved over time by revisiting completed assignments and projects.
- **Share Knowledge**: This repository can also serve as a source of inspiration and learning for others interested in similar topics. By sharing, we can enrich each other's knowledge.
- **Facilitate Access**: With all the materials stored in one place, I can easily access them whenever and wherever I need them.

### What Will You Find Here?

In this repository, you'll find a variety of things, including:

- College assignments
- Personal projects
- Notes or summaries from books or learning materials
- And perhaps some other experiments or small projects
